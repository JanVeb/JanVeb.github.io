I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything

of what each of the values mean.

    ‚Äã‚ÄãSince 2002, when I paused my school in Croatia, I've started to actively
    work, mostly in the tourism and hospitality sector. In 2006 I moved to
    Slovenia and in 2007 I enrolled in Philosophy and next year for a Psychology
    bachelor degree. In 2012 I've moved to Munich, Germany. In Germany, through
    Kruschina agency I've worked in big international companies, such as Intel,
    Microsoft, Allianz Arena, BMW, IBM, and others,

    In 2019, while studying Chinese at National Taiwan Normal University, I met
    Phillip Schluetermann, trained Javascript developer, and we started to
    develop a Chinese learning app. Since it was too expensive for us to develop
    good quality Chinese audio learning materials, we stopped working on this
    project. I've started learning Flutter, developed dozens of projects in it
    for learning purposes, and started to develop a Piano Learning app in it as
    well, though, due to lack of functional music sheet plugins in Dart
    language, I've started to develop this project in Javascript instead. Piano
    Flashcard app is a great project in that it was almost free to create,
    learning materials, such as countless great music scores are in public
    domain and therefore, was able to use them free of charge in the project. In
    July of 2021 I started working remotely for Company Kobilica from Croatia,
    mostly working on mobile development in Javascript and Dart languages.
